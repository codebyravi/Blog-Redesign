Rewrite my old blog system with new patterns

TODO:

- [x] Style navbar
- [x] `sanitizing HTML stripped some content` warning
- [x] Use firebase as database
- [x] Style blog detail
- [ ] Enhance pagination to `Previous  1  2  3 ... 8  9  Next` if has too many pages
- [ ] Tag system
- [x] Choose a markdown parser
- [ ] Comment to blog (Using firestore, which is not a real-time database. Might can't display comment in real-time, need more research)
- [x] 404 page
- [ ] Responsive
- [ ] More to add...
